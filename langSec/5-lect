Stack smashing

Protection
- Type-safe languages
  + CCured
  + Cyclone
  + Rust
- Safe functions & libs
- Static aalysis
  + ITS4
  + Flawfinder
  + RATS
  + Splint
  + BOON
- Run-time analysis
  + Purify
  + Stackguard compiler 
  + Stack Shiedl
  + ProPolice
- System support
  + Non-executable stack
  + address obfuscation

Database security
- Encrypt connection to DB
- Usr auth + AC
- Protection (clearance levels)
- Sensistive fields needs more prot than AC
- Encryption of sensitive data
- Secure information Retrival
- Statistical atks
  + analyze statistical inferences
  + restric query languages
  + introduce fake tuples
  + introduce noice
  + give approximate answers (small regions becomes included in a larger region)
