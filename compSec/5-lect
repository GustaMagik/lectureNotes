Buffer Overflow
$$$$$$$$$$
Write over return to addresses with executable code
that in some steps give you control of the system

Typical injection vector
	NOP-sled | shellcode | address of shellcode 
You begin with a lot of subsequent nop operations
then you only have to hit one of the nops to get to your shellcode :)
Usually packed to avoid having '\0' read of as end of string
