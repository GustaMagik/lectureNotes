Auth Principles
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
user auth - identifier + authenticatior
1. identification
2. auth info
3. transmission of info to sys
2. verification

Authenticatiors:
- knowledge
- possession
- biometrics
- location ?

token (authenticators)
tokens trades for access

biometrics yield some % of false positives

evil eve
router manipulation
replay attacks

keygrabber

downsides:
- knowledge
	* stolen?
- possession
	* cost?
	* notice stolen
- biometrics
	* practical vs. theoretical
