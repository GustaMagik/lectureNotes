Network layer security
-------------------
IPv4 format
[bit 0 → bit 31]
version (4) :: header len(4) :: QoS (8) :: Total len (16)
fragment id (16) :: flags(DontFragment, MF) :: fragment offset(13)
time to live(8) :: protocol (8) :: Header checksum (16)
source IP (32)
dest IP (32)
options if any :: padding
data

IP spoof ⇒ never rely on IP address for security purposes
What happens if header length has the value < 20 bytes?
- depends on the hosts way to deal with incoming packs, some doesnt drop the pack
What if datageam len differs from actual length
- actual > header specified → buffer overrun
- actual < specified → reuse old data in buffer, might be sent back etc.

Networks should do ingress and gress filtering
- check all in/out comm to see that addresses are ok
Should drop
- broadcast addr as dest
- multicasta ddress as source
- unassigned addresses

- {0/0} & {0/host}
- {-1/-1} drop if source (broadcast)
- {ourNW/-1} drop
- {ourNW/-1} invalid if source
- {127/*}  

IP fragmentation problems
- teardrop
- new teardrop
- boink

teardrop
- jack in a box, overlapping
- worked pga linux optimization, dont read allready read data → copy alot of data

boink
- extend fragmented data outside of the expected size
- leeds to long wait for no more pack → bufferspace exhausted

in all cases of IP fragmentation probs, the reassembly of the data can go very wrong.

Ping-o-death
- huge offset + accepted datasize → outside datagram size → crash
- implementation specific protocol ICMP

Fragment id should be unique per {source,dest,prot}
- some systems inc ID for each pck sent (leak info about transmission rate)
- idle

older linux and solaris - id unique per ip address pair

OpenBSD - ranom number ID
- collisions can occur

Idle scanning

IP options problems
- LSR and SSR should never be allowed
  + can be used to reach unreachable systems
  + avoid firewalls/IDS systems

TTL field and ICMP
traceroute
ping
firewalking (ICMP echo reply as tracerout msg can break through FW)
- firewall shouldn't forward internal time exceeded replies to the outside
- firewalls should be stateful

Drop more ICMP msgs?
- Many are usefull, some are usable for attackers
- Destination unreachable leaks info about what is the error and if the msg is to long for the router/system on the path (fragmentation needed)
Path MTU discovery
- Source Quench, good to have but abusable for thtottling a users bandwidth
- Redirect

OpenBSD and NetBSD (good implementations)
- Initial PMTU
- Path MTU update
