..Cutting plane method.. -- works for general convex sets
LP - Minimize list of constraints
- find a violated constraint
- add it
- repeat
- stop when you have no violated constriants

finding the planes : separation problem

inner SEC - any subset mustn't contain cycles 
outer SEC - the sum of edge variables between two sets less than 2

For TSP the separation problem is min-cut → polytime

LP-relaxations, can become arbitrarily bad

convex hull - convex set defined by the outmost nodes of the set

..Held-Karp bound/Lagrangian relaxation..
min cᵀx
s.t.
A₁x ≥ b₁ - hard ← penalize violation
A₂x ≥ b₂ - easy
     ↓
min cᵀx + λᵀ(b₁-A₁x) → Lagrange dual selects best λ
s.t.
A₂x ≥ b₂
λ ≥ 0
lagrange ⇒ at least as good as LP relaxation  

held-karp bound for TSP
1-tree bound 
 c(e) + c(f) + c(p) 
 A ≤ c(e)+c(f) - A : pick the 2 smallest paths
 B ≤ c(p)      - B : MST(G\v) - v : G graph, v node connected to edges e and f.

want to change edge weights 
s.t. 
- all hamilton cycles change by the same know amount
- MST becomes "most path-like"
