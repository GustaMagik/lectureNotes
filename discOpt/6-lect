Magic square
when minimizing flip equality
when maximizing have the same direction

0≤x A ≥c
0≤y A ≤b

c₁x₁+c₂x₂≤y₁a₁+y₂a₂≤y₁b₁+y₂b₂
max      duality gap      min

a dual is a problem that gives you and bound on the problem (upper for max, lower for min)
-----------------------------
Max flow - min cut

min cut
set s:0 t:1 find along each path s→t the edge with lowest capacity. Minimization of edgevariables times their capacity. Either select an edge or not, see lect notes (0's in one set, 1's in the other)

Max-flow ⟺ Min-cut due to strong duality because of totally unimodular (TUM).
