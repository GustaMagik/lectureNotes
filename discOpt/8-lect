adjacency matrix
----------------
relation node to node

incidence matrix
----------------
relation node to edge
out of node: 1
in to node: -1
no relation: 0
loops: 0
TUM

graphs
------
tree: no cycles
forest: multiple disjoint trees
bipartite
tournament

maximal - local/cant add more
maximum - global

matching: set of edges s.t. no 2 edges are adjacent
mst: with weighted edges get minimum value 

bridges of k√∂nigsberg
- no euler path 
- river Pregel

Euler Path: round trip using every edge once
Hamilton cycle: round trip using each node once
TSP: 
Directed Asyclic Graph: (used in shortest path algos)
