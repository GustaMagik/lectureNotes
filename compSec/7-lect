- Cryptography
  + Encryption
  + Decryption
  + Plain/Clear
  + Ciphertext
  + Key
- Crypanalysis
  + Reverse engineering

Symmetric key
- Shared key
- secure channel, obide C.I.A., might be:
  + slow
  + expensive
  + exisiting only at one point in time
- Cryptanalyst
  + assumption: knows all but key
  + attack types
    * chipertext only
    * known-plaintext
    * chosen-plaintext/chosen-chipertext
  + Theoretical
    * unlimited time
    * successfull analysis leads to only 1 message decrypted
- Diffusion, change; symbol plain → many chiper, key → much chiper
- Confusion, scheme provides a chiper that is resilient to statistical analysis
- DES → 3DES (don't use)
- AES /Rijndael
- Key lengths
  + computational complexity
- One-time pad 
  + rng string used only once as key
  + problem the secure channel: send the key, could send message instead
  + repeated usage of key → no security

"In general, a symmetric key chiper is secure if no method is less expensive than bruteforce"

Asymmetric
- Slower encryption
- Usage: setup secure channel
- 2 key, must prove authenticity
- One way fnc
- signature, no confidentiallity, but authentication
- sign → crypt → transmitt → decrypt → verify
- Diffie-Hellman
- Rivest-Shamir-Aldeman
  + Break: 
    * Algos
    * Computational efficiency
  + GNUPG - lab
    * plain → crypt msg with sess-key → pack → send  
              crypt session key       →  ^

Signatures

Problems
- Key Management
- Key escrow
- Trust
- Certificates
