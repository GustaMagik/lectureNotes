adjacency matrix
----------------
relation node to node

incidence matrix
----------------
relation node to edge
out of node: 1
in to node: -1
no relation: 0
loops: 0

graphs
------
tree: no cycles
forest: multiple disjoint trees
bipartite
tournament

maximal - local/cant add more
maximum - global

matching: set of edges s.t. no 2 edges are adjacent
mst: with weighted edges get minimum value 

bridges of königsberg
- no euler path 
- river Pregel

Euler Path: round trip using every edge once
Hamilton cycle: round trip using each node once
TSP: 
Directed Asyclic Graph: (used in shortest path algos)

Primal-Dual Method
1. Some feasible dual solution y
2. "Force primal closer to optimum" : find some x which minimizes complementary slackness violations with y, using the restricted primal
	Restricted Primal
	a. minimize slack for primal non-binding constraints where dual variables are not zero. ∀i∈⊥ᶜ ∑aᵢⱼxⱼ-sᵢ=bᵢ ⊥∈{i|y}
	b. minimize primal variables where the dual constraints are non-binding

	min ∑ sᵢ + ∑xⱼ : i∈⊥ᶜ, j∈Jᶜ, J∈{j|∑aᵢⱼyᵢ=cⱼ}
3. Id solution to RP is 0 x,y, are optimal since CS holds, else find a better y in terms of the dual
Idea: bᵀy < bᵀy+εbᵀζ : εbᵗζ > 0, y+εζ feasible dual solution

⊥ = {i | yᵢ = 0}
J = {j | ∑aᵢⱼyᵢ = cⱼ}
restricted primal: min  ∑sᵢ + ∑xⱼ : i∈⊥ᶜ, j∈Jᶜ
                   s.t. ∀i∈⊥: ∑aᵢⱼxⱼ≥bᵢ
                        ∀i∈⊥ᶜ: ∑aᵢⱼxⱼ-sᵢ=bᵢ
