Network Security
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
C & I in CIA is very important for networking

net is insecure medium
unknown path over network
anonymity (tor, etc)

Port scanning variant: stealth scanning (hidden that you scan)

IP/ARP/WEB/DNS Spoofing
- IP exploits trust
  + DOS trusted host
  + impersonate that host
- WEB site look-alike
  + fool users onto fake sites (they trust)
- DNS directing users to fake servers that hand out fake sites
  + DNS poisoning
- ARP LAN atk that uses a PC on the network to try and steal incoming trafic

MIM
- ARP poisoning
- ICMP redirection
- DNS poisoning
- Web spoofing

Firewalls
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
Access control device between 2 nets
Filters outgoing and incoming msgs
Stance: default firewall policy (deny/permit)
Layers
- packet filter
  + checks every packet, decides (accept/deny)
  + uses: src ip, src port, dest ip, dest port, of pkgs
- application-level gateway(proxy)
- circuit-level gateway
- stateful inspection
  + checks chains of packets, builds flows

DMZ (Demilitarized zone) 
- separate network into parts 
- different levels of access in parts

Protects you from the outside
Does not protect form 
- insiders 
- viruses
- data-driven attacks
Open for availability atks

problems
- needs maintainance
- difficult to test
- installation is difficult to do correctly

VPNs
- does not protect the PCs outside the firewall they can then infect the network via allowed traffic

Kerberos
££££££££££££££££
Network protocol
Auth system
- Secure, against eve
- reliable
- transparent (to user)
- scalable
pwds
- stored in kerberos (auth server)
- never sent over net

ticket granting service
- auth user

 login once per session
1. user sends ID to auth server
2. auth server gives back auth ticket (encrypted)
3. auth tick sent to TGS
4. TGS gives user service ticket
5. service ticket used to use service

clock sync is important for security in kerberos

the protocol is considered to be secure
however the implementations of kerberos have 
and have had issues due to coding errors

TimeOfCheckTimeOfUse - race conditions
