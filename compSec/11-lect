IntrusionDetectionSystem
- Anomaly-based : rules for what is normal, alarm otherwise 
  + more interesting today
- Missuse : rules for what is missuse
- Network IDS
  + general application
- Host IDS
  + specific
- Problems
  + ML has class imbalance (normal vs. threat)
  + false alarms
  + portability (needs to be tailored)
  + test methods (weak)
  + scalability (NIDS, bottle neck)
  + privacy conserns (logging incoming data)
Future
- "Intrusion Prevension Systems"
  + when detecting things, take action (change firewall, drop connection etc)
- problems
  + increasing net-traffic + speed = problem analysing
  + encryption
- posibilities
  + tolerance
  + ex. FRS

Honeypots
- Decoy
- Collect atk info
- steal atk time
