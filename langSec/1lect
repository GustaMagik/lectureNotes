OWASP Goth (Lindholmen) Tuesday 27th march

---------------------------------------------

Least Privilege
- OS eforces sec @ system call layer (course-grained control)
- Applications can enforce fine-grained control
  + track who did what when, use for controlling

Principle of Security Design
- Strive for small Trusted Computing Base
- Easier to check/ensure correctness of a small TCB

Melissa - Macro virus
- Solution needs to prevent bad actions by code without making the good actions go away.


Enforce same origin policy
- XSS atk can still extract info

Defence against malic code
- Analyze
- Rewrite
- Monitor
- Audit

Concepts for lang based security
--------------------------------
Static certification (type systems)
- code producer → {code} code consumer (analyze → reject/deploy)

Proof-carrying code
- code producer (produce + analyze) → {code + proof} → code consumer (verify → (reject/deploy))

Software-based reference monitors
- code producer → {code} → code consumer (add policy specific monitoring code → deploy + monitor)
---------------------------------

#1 Secure the weakest link
Id weakest link (usually not crypto), may not be code, might be social/behavioural based

#2 Practice Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security
- ex: CSP policies + secure code on webpage

#3 Fail Securely
- Dont give away info when the system fail

#4 Principle of Least Privilege

#5 Compartmentalize
- Separate system so that breach of one part does not give away the whole system.
- Separation of duty

#6 Keep it Simple
- Complexity introduces bugs
- Failsafe defaults

#7 Promote Privacy
- GDPR

#8 Hiding Secrets is Hard
- Minimize number of secrets in the system

#9 Be reluctant to trust
- Small TCB = Better
- Trust is transitive

#10 Use Community Resources
- Dont make your own crypto and use it
- Use resources out there
- Enlist help from the community to audit
