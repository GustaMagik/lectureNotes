TSP
%%%%%%%%%%%
minimum weight hamiltonian cycle
- it is NPC to decide if a graph is hamiltonian
Euclidian TPS
- d(u,v)=‖u-v‖₂
- without skipping the cost would be 2*MST total cost
- with skipping MST≤c≤2*MST
- 2 approx

Theorem:
Unless P=NP there exists no polytime α-approximation for TSP for any α≥1.
